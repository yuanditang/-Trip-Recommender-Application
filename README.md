**Course:** DS5110 - Summer 2025  
**Instructor:** Professor Nafa  
**Date:** June 2, 2025  

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Trip Recommender Application** is designed to help users discover personalized travel destinations based on their unique preferences and constraints. By leveraging external APIs, a structured database, and intelligent recommendation logic, this application provides curated destination suggestions tailored to each user's travel style and budget.

## 🚀 Features

- **API Integration**  
  Retrieve real-time data on destinations including:
  - Climate and weather conditions
  - Attractions and points of interest
  - Estimated travel costs and cost of living
  - Additional travel-relevant information

- **Custom Database**  
  A centralized repository for all processed and fetched data to support fast and reliable recommendations.

- **Smart Recommendation Engine**  
  Matches user preferences (budget, climate, duration, etc.) with destinations using a rules-based or ML-driven algorithm.

- **Interactive User Interface**  
  Clean and intuitive front-end for:
  - Entering travel preferences
  - Viewing recommended destinations
  - Accessing detailed destination information
